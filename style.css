This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Rip it apart or use it as-is - entirely up to you!

The SCSS files are located in assets/scss and are compiled to assets/css/style.css

Most of the React stuff  happens in assets/js, where the most important file is /assets/js/reactionary-source.js
This is an ECMAscript 2015/jsx file which is transpiled to vanilla javaScript in assets/js/reactionary.js - this is the file that is loaded in the browser.
